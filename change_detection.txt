************* Change Detection Strategies *****************

Default:
    - Uses the default checkAlways strategy
    - Every component is checked when:
        - Any change detected

OnPush:
    - Improves performance by minimizing change detection cycles
    - Component is only checked when:
        - @Input properties change
        - Event emits
        - A bound Observable emits
